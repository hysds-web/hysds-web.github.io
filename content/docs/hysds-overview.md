The Hybrid Cloud Science Data System, or HySDS (pronounced Hi-S-D-S) started development in 2009 at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Science data systems ingest raw scientific data as input and process it into more useful information (climate models, CO2 levels, water levels, etc). JPL's HySDS processes satellite and radar data for use in natural disaster response (ARIA), climate monitoring and prediction (OCO2), and many other large scale projects that need real time environmental data.
