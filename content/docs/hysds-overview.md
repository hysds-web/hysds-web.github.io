The Hybrid Cloud Science Data System, or HySDS (pronounced Hi-S-D-S) started development in 2009 at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Science data systems ingest raw scientific data as input and process it into more useful information (climate models, CO2 levels, water levels, etc). JPL's HySDS processes satellite and radar data for use in natural disaster response (ARIA), climate monitoring and prediction (OCO2), and many other large scale projects that need real time environmental data.

As a Hybrid Cloud system, HySDS leverages the processing power of the cloud and on premise computing. This allows maximum flexibility as projects can be scaled up or down as required in a cost efficient way. The mission of HySDS is to provide powerful computing resources to the scientific research community. This way, if one needs to process several petabytes of data, they can do so in several hours without having to utilize an on-site data center. It was released as open source software in 2017 under the Apache License.
