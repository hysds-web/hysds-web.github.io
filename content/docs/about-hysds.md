As a Hybrid Cloud system, HySDS leverages the processing power of the cloud and on premise computing. This allows maximum flexibility as projects can be scaled up or down as required in a cost efficient way. The mission of HySDS is to provide powerful computing resources to the scientific research community. This way, if one needs to process several petabytes of data, they can do so in several hours without having to utilize an on-site data center. It was released as open source software in 2017 under the Apache License.
